# android-architecture-sample
A sample app that demonstrates basics of MVP, MVVM &amp; MVI in Android. 

This repository is an extension of my article discussing evolution of Android Architectures: https://medium.com/@gauravsapiens/the-evolution-of-android-architectures-mvp-mvvm-mvi-f72f67093b81

***Note**: This repository is just for conceptual clarity of above architectures. And doesn't use any library or production-ready framework.
Hence, I would advice not to directly use patterns here in production-level code.*
